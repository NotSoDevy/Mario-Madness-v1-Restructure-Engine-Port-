Unofficial Restructure Engine port of the first version of Mario Madness. The modpack is made for fun and is NOT associated with the MM Team.

# Warning
Super early modpack build. May contain alot of unfinished shit and bugs. Also, I have no plans on porting v2 because it would take a long time
to port alot of stuff, which is why I am doing version 1.

# How To Play
Download the mod pack and extract it. After doing so, put it inside Restrcture Engine's "mods" folder.

If you do not have Restructure Engine installed, you can do it through here:
https://github.com/SlightlySimple/FNF-Restructure-Engine

Make sure you download the latest version of the engine.
